CS410J Project 4 :  A REST-ful Phone Bill Web Service
Forbes Miyasato

The Phone Bill Application's Command Line Client reads in a series of options and arguments with information regarding
the phone bill and phone call, fetches data from the servlet via a rest client, and then parses the data in order to
present the user with a description of the PhoneCall and store PhoneBills. There's also REST access to the Phone Bill
Application that supports different formats of URL in order to retrieve data.

Command line usage: java edu.pdx.cs410J.<login-id>.Project4 [options] <args>
args are (in this order):

callerNumber Phone number of caller

-port port Port on which the server is listening
-search Phone calls should be searched for
